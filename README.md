# hello-world
My first GitHub repository
I'm the webmaster at Anne Arundel County Public Library and the only web designer/developer on staff. I used CVS versioning way back in the aughts, but never required versioning since I came on staff here. I may be using a hosted solution for our websites soon, and so really need to learn this stuff again.
